## Contributing

Sass Guidelines is a free project that I maintain in my spare time. Needless to say, it is quite a large amount of work to keep everything up-to-date, documented and relevant. Thankfully, I get helped by a lot of great contributors, especially when it comes to maintaining dozens of <a href="#options-panel" class="link-like">different translations</a>. Be sure to thank them!

Now if you feel like contributing, please know that tweeting about it, spreading the word, or fixing a tiny typo by opening an issue or a pull-request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-guidelines) would be great!

Last but not least before we start: if you enjoyed this document, or if it is useful for you or your team, please consider supporting it so I can keep working on it!
