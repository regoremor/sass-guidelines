## Mixins

Mixins are one of the most used features from the whole Sass language. They are the key to reusability and DRY components. And for good reason: mixins allow authors to define styles that can be reused throughout the stylesheet without needing to resort to non-semantic classes such as `.float-left`.

They can contain full CSS rules and pretty much everything that is allowed anywhere in a Sass document. They can even take arguments, just like functions. Needless to say, the possibilities are endless.

But I feel I must warn you against abusing the power of mixins. Again, the keyword here is *simplicity*. It might be tempting to build extremely powerful mixins with massive amounts of logic. It’s called over-engineering and most developers suffer from it. Don’t overthink your code, and above all keep it simple. If a mixin ends up being longer than 20 lines or so, then it should be either split into smaller chunks or completely revised.

### Basics

That being said, mixins are extremely useful and you should be using some. The rule of thumb is that if you happen to spot a group of CSS properties that always appear together for a reason (i.e. not a coincidence), you can put them in a mixin instead. The [micro-clearfix hack from Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/) deserves to be put in a (argumentless) mixin for instance.

{% include snippets/mixins/01/index.html %}

Another valid example would be a mixin to size an element, defining both `width` and `height` at the same time. Not only would it make the code lighter to type, but also easier to read.

{% include snippets/mixins/02/index.html %}

For more complex examples of mixins, have a look at [this mixin to generate CSS triangles](https://www.sitepoint.com/sass-mixin-css-triangles/), [this mixin to create long shadows](https://www.sitepoint.com/ultimate-long-shadow-sass-mixin/) or [this mixin to polyfill CSS gradients for old browsers](https://www.sitepoint.com/building-linear-gradient-mixin-sass/).

### Argument-less mixins

Sometimes mixins are used only to avoid repeating the same group of declarations over and over again, yet do not need any parameter or have sensible enough defaults so that we don’t necessarily have to pass arguments.

In such cases, we can safely omit the parentheses when calling them. The `@include` keyword (or `+` sign in indented-syntax) already acts as an indicator that the line is a mixin call; there is no need for extra parentheses here.

{% include snippets/mixins/08/index.html %}

### Arguments list

When dealing with an unknown number of arguments in a mixin, always use an `arglist` rather than a list. Think of `arglist` as the 8th hidden undocumented data type from Sass that is implicitly used when passing an arbitrary number of arguments to a mixin or a function whose signature contains `...`.

{% include snippets/mixins/03/index.html %}

Now, when building a mixin that accepts a handful of arguments (understand 3 or more), think twice before merging them out as a list or a map thinking it will be easier than passing them all one by one.

Sass is actually pretty clever with mixins and function declarations, so much so that you can actually pass a list or a map as an arglist to a function/mixin so that it gets parsed as a series of arguments.

{% include snippets/mixins/04/index.html %}

For more information on whether it is best to use multiple arguments, a list or an argument list, [SitePoint has a nice piece on the topic](https://www.sitepoint.com/sass-multiple-arguments-lists-or-arglist/).

### Mixins and vendor prefixes

It might be tempting to define custom mixins to handle vendor prefixes for unsupported or partially supported CSS properties. But we do not want to do this. First, if you can use [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), use Autoprefixer. It will remove Sass code from your project, will always be up-to-date and will necessarily do a much better job than you at prefixing stuff.

Unfortunately, Autoprefixer is not always an option. If you use either [Bourbon](https://bourbon.io/) or [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), you may already know that they both provide a collection of mixins that handle vendor prefixes for you. Use those.

If you cannot use Autoprefixer and use neither Bourbon nor Compass, then and only then, you can have your own mixin for prefixing CSS properties. But. Please do not build a mixin per property, manually printing each vendor.

{% include snippets/mixins/05/index.html %}

Do it the clever way.

{% include snippets/mixins/06/index.html %}

Then using this mixin should be very straightforward:

{% include snippets/mixins/07/index.html %}

Please keep in mind this is a poor solution. For instance, it cannot deal with complex polyfills such as those required for Flexbox. In that sense, using Autoprefixer would be a far better option.
