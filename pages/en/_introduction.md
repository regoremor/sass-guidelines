## Introduction

### Why a styleguide

A styleguide is not just a pleasing document to read, picturing an ideal state for your code. It is a key document in a project’s life, describing how and why code should be written. It may look like overkill for small projects, but it helps a lot in keeping the codebase clean, scalable and easily maintainable.

Needless to say, the more developers involved on a project, the more code guidelines are needed. Along the same lines, the bigger the project, the more a styleguide is a must.

[Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com) states it very well in [CSS Guidelines](https://cssguidelin.es/#the-importance-of-a-styleguide):

<blockquote>
  <p>A coding styleguide (note, not a visual styleguide) is a valuable tool for teams who:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>build and maintain products for a reasonable length of time;</li>
    <li>have developers of differing abilities and specialties;</li>
    <li>have a number of different developers working on a product at any given time;</li>
    <li>on-board new staff regularly;</li>
    <li>have a number of codebases that developers dip in and out of.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

### Disclaimer

First things first: **this is not a CSS styleguide**. This document will not discuss naming conventions for CSS classes, modular patterns and the question of IDs in the CSS world. These guidelines only aim at dealing with Sass-specific content.

Also, this styleguide is my own and therefore **very opinionated**. Think of it as a collection of methodologies and advice that I have polished and given over the years. It also gives me the opportunity to link to a handful of insightful resources, so be sure to check the *further readings*.

Obviously, this is certainly not the only way of doing things, and it may or may not suit your project. Feel free to pick from it and adapt it to your needs. As we say, *your mileage may vary*.

### Key principles

At the end of the day, if there is one thing I would like you to get from this whole styleguide, it is that **[Sass should be kept as simple as it can be](https://www.sitepoint.com/keep-sass-simple/)**.

Thanks to my silly experiments like [bitwise operators](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/SassyBitwise), [iterators and generators](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/SassyIteratorsGenerators) and [a JSON parser](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/SassyJSON) in Sass, we are all well aware of what one can do with this preprocessor.

Meanwhile, CSS is a simple language. Sass, being intended to write CSS, should not get much more complex than regular CSS. The [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) (Keep It Simple Stupid) is key here and may even take precedence over the [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (Don’t Repeat Yourself) in some circumstances.

Sometimes, it’s better to repeat a little to keep the code maintainable, rather than building a top-heavy, unwieldy, unnecessarily complicated system that is completely unmaintainable because it is overly complex.

Also, and let me quote [Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com) once again, **pragmatism trumps perfection**. At some point, you will probably find yourself going against the rules described here. If it makes sense, if it feels right, do it. Code is just a means, not an end.

### Extending the guidelines

A large part of this styleguide is strongly opinionated. I have been reading and writing Sass for several years now, to the point where I now have a lot of principles when it comes to writing clean stylesheets. I understand that it might not please nor suit everybody, and this is perfectly normal.

Although, I believe that guidelines are made to be extended. Extending Sass Guidelines could be as simple as having a document stating that the code is following the guidelines from this styleguide except for a few things; in which case, specific rules would be explained below.

An example of styleguide extension can be found on the [SassDoc repository](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc/blob/master/GUIDELINES.md):
