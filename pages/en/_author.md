## About the author

My name is [Kitty Giraudel](https://kittygiraudel.com), I am a French front-end developer, based in Berlin (Germany) since 2015, currently working at [Cofenster](https://www.cofenster.com).

I have been writing Sass for several years now and I am the author of many Sass-related projects such as [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com), SitePoint Sass Reference and [Sass-Compatibility](https://kittygiraudel.github.io/sass-compatibility/). If you are interested in more of my contributions to the Sass community, have a look at [that list](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/awesome-sass).

I also happen to be the author of a book about CSS (in French) entitled [CSS3 Pratique du Design Web](https://www.eyrolles.com/Informatique/Livre/css3-9782212678963/) (*Eyrolles* editions), as well as a book about Sass (in English) entitled [Jump Start Sass](https://learnable.com/books/jump-start-sass) (*Learnable* editions).
